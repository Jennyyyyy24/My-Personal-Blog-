# My Personal Blog — A Gentle Space for Healing

My Personal Blog is a web project I built for my community initiative, inspired by children battling cancer who wished for a calm, creative space to express themselves. Many of them shared that writing, drawing, or simply reflecting helped them feel lighter — that’s when I decided to create a digital version of that safe space.

This project is designed as a personal online diary, combining comfort and simplicity. Users can write journal entries, track moods, leave sticky notes, and store precious moments through a polaroid wall feature. A built-in calendar, to-do list, and mind dump section help children reflect, plan, and find small moments of peace in their daily lives.

The soft pink and ivory tones, gentle animations, and handwritten-style fonts were chosen to create a sense of warmth and reassurance. Every visual and interaction was designed with care — not just to be functional, but to feel emotionally safe.

Technically, My Personal Blog is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with all data stored locally via localStorage, ensuring privacy and easy offline use. It doesn’t require sign-ups or internet access, making it suitable for hospital environments and shared systems.

This project is a small reminder that technology can comfort, too — by giving children a quiet place to express their thoughts, track their progress, and remind themselves that healing isn’t just physical, but emotional too.

# My Personal Blog — built with love, for little hearts that dream big even on their hardest days.
